## Motivation
After encountering this issue ![issue](/issue.gif) in many sites, I decided to make a simple solution for it that works with almost all front end frameworks and libraries.

Thanks for [Drahim](https://drah.im/login) for the idea.

## How did I do it
I certainly do not know how to use all frameworks but to this I used [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/tree/main) to generate the input for almost all frameworks used today e.g (React,Solid,Vue,Angular,etc).
